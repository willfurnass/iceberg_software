Intel Math Kernel Library
=========================

Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL) provides highly optimized, threaded and vectorized functions to maximize performance on each processor family.
It Utilises de-facto standard C and Fortran APIs for compatibility with BLAS, LAPACK and FFTW functions from other math libraries.

Parallel Studio Composer Edition version
----------------------------------------

MKL can be used with and without :ref:`other Parallel Studio packages <sharc-intel-parallel-studio>`.
Load a specific version using one of the following: ::

   module load libs/intel-mkl/2019.3/binary
   module load libs/intel-mkl/2017.0/binary
   module load libs/intel-mkl/2016.1/binary
   module load libs/intel-mkl/2015.7/binary

Sample C and Fortran programs demonstrating matrix multiplication 
are available for **version 2017.0** in the directory ``$MKL_SAMPLES``: ::

   $ ls $MKL_SAMPLES/
   mkl_c_samples  mkl_fortran_samples

To compile one of these you need to copy the samples to a directory you can write to, 
ensure the MKL and the *Intel compilers* are both loaded,
change into the directory containing the relevant sample program (C or Fortran) then
run ``make`` to compile: ::

   $ qrsh 
   $ cp -r $MKL_SAMPLES/ ~/mkl_samples
   $ module load dev/intel-compilers/17.0.0 
   $ module load libs/intel-mkl/2017.0/binary
   $ cd ~/mkl_samples/mkl_fortran_samples/matrix_multiplication
   $ make

   ifort -c src/dgemm_example.f -o release/dgemm_example.o
   ifort release/dgemm_example.o -mkl -static-intel -o release/dgemm_example
   ifort -c src/dgemm_with_timing.f -o release/dgemm_with_timing.o
   ifort release/dgemm_with_timing.o -mkl -static-intel -o release/dgemm_with_timing
   ifort -c src/matrix_multiplication.f -o release/matrix_multiplication.o
   ifort release/matrix_multiplication.o -mkl -static-intel -o release/matrix_multiplication
   ifort -c src/dgemm_threading_effect_example.f -o release/dgemm_threading_effect_example.o
   ifort release/dgemm_threading_effect_example.o -mkl -static-intel -o release/dgemm_threading_effect_example

You should then find several compiled programs in the ``release`` directory: ::

   $ ./release/matrix_multiplication
   This example measures performance of computing the real
   matrix product C=alpha*A*B+beta*C using
   a triple nested loop, where A, B, and C are matrices
   and alpha and beta are double precision scalars
   
   Initializing data for matrix multiplication C=A*B for 
   matrix A( 2000 x  200) and matrix B(  200 x 1000)
   
   Intializing matrix data
   
   Making the first run of matrix product using 
   triple nested loop to get stable run time
   measurements

   triple nested loop

For documentation and a tutorial, start an :ref:`interactive graphical session <sched_interactive>` , load a version of the MKL, then run: ::

   firefox $MKL_SAMPLES/mkl_fortran_samples/matrix_multiplication/tutorial/en/index.htm
