R (Intel Build)

R is a statistical computing language. 
This version of R is built using the :ref:`Intel compilers <iceberg_intel_compilers>` and 
the Intel Math Kernel Library. 
This combination can result in significantly faster runtimes in certain circumstances.
For more details of what is made faster, 
see `this blog post <https://rse.shef.ac.uk/blog/intel-r-iceberg/>`_
which was written back when we built this version of R for the first time on Sheffield's old HPC system, Iceberg.

Most R extensions are written and tested for the gcc suite of compilers so 
it is recommended that you perform testing before switching to this version of R.

Loading the modules
-------------------

After connecting to ShARC (see :ref:`ssh`), 
:ref:`start an interactive session <sched_interactive>`.

There are two types of the Intel builds of R, ``sequential`` and ``parallel``.

``sequential`` makes use of one CPU core and 
can be used as a drop-in replacement for the standard version of R installed on ShARC: ::

   module load apps/R/3.5.1/intel-17.0-sequential
   module load apps/R/3.4.0/intel-17.0-sequential
   module load apps/R/3.3.2/intel-17.0-sequential

The ``parallel`` version makes use of multiple CPU cores for certain linear algebra routines 
since it is linked to the Intel MKL. 
Note that **only** linear algebra routines are automatically parallelised. ::

   module load apps/R/3.5.1/intel-17.0-parallel
   module load apps/R/3.4.0/intel-17.0-parallel
   module load apps/R/3.3.2/intel-17.0-parallel

When using the ``parallel`` module, you must also ensure that you 
set the bash environment variable ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` to the number of cores you require 
and also use the ``smp`` parallel environment.  
E.g. add the following to your submission script: ::

   #$ -pe smp 8

   # Set OMP_NUM_THREADS to the number of cores requested using '-pe smp'
   export OMP_NUM_THREADS=$NSLOTS

   module load apps/R/3.5.1/intel-17.0-parallel

Installing additional packages
------------------------------

To ensure that the Intel builds do not contaminate the standard gcc builds, 
the Intel R module files set the environment variable ``R_LIBS_USER`` to point to 
``~/R/intel_R/parallel-3.5.1/`` or ``~/R/intel_R/sequential-3.5.1/`` respectively 
for version 3.5.1 with similar paths for other versions.

As a user, you should not need to worry about this detail and just install packages as you usually would from within R e.g. ::

    install.packages("dplyr")

The Intel builds of R will use the Intel compiler suite, instead of gcc and gfortran, 
to compile any C++ or Fortran extensions.
The Intel build of R will ignore any packages installed in your home directory 
for the standard version of R and vice versa.

Installation Notes
