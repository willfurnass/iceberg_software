    #!/bin/bash
    #$ -cwd
    #$ -l h_rt=00:30:00
    #$ -l rmem=2G
    #$ -pe mpi 4

    module load apps/molpro/2015.1.22/binary

    molpro -n 4 my_input.inp

The script requests 4 cores using the Open MPI parallel environment ``mpi`` with a runtime of 30 mins and 2 GB of real memory per core. The Molpro input file is ``my_input.inp``.
