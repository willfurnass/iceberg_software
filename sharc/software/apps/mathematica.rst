Mathematica is a technical computing environment and programming language with strong symbolic and numerical abilities.

Single Core Interactive Usage
-----------------------------
After connecting to ShARC (see :ref:`ssh`) ,
:ref:`start an interactive session <sched_interactive>` then
load a specific version of Mathematica using: ::

   module load apps/mathematica/12.0.0/binary

Mathematica can then be started using: ::

   mathematica

Multicore Interactive Usage
---------------------------

Mathematica has extensive parallel functionality.
To use it, you should request a parallel interactive session.
For example, to request 4 cores: ::

   qrshx -pe smp 2

Load and launch Mathematica: ::

   module load apps/mathematica/12.0.0/binary
   mathematica

In Mathematica, let's time how long it takes to calculate the first 20 million primes on 1 CPU core: ::

   AbsoluteTiming[primelist = Table[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000}];]

Now, let's launch 2 Parallel Kernels and redo the calculation in parallel: ::

   LaunchKernels[2]
   AbsoluteTiming[primelist =
   ParallelTable[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000},
   Method -> "CoarsestGrained"];]

This illustrates a couple of points:

* You should always request the same number of kernels as you requested when you started your interactive session (in this case, 2).
* N kernels doesn't always translate to N times faster.

Batch Submission
----------------

Unfortunately, it is not possible to run Mathematica notebook ``.nb`` files directly in batch.
Instead, you need to create a simple text file that contains all of the Mathematica commands you want to execute.
Typically, such files are given the extension ``.m``.
Letâ€™s run the following simple Mathematica script as a batch job: ::

   (*Find out what version of Mathematica this machine is running*)
   Print["Mathematica version is " <> $Version]

   (*Find out the name of the machine we are running on*)
   Print["The machine name is " <> $MachineName]

   (*Do a calculation*)
   Print["The result of the integral is "]
   Print [ Integrate[Sin[x]^2, x]]

Copy and paste the above into a text file called ``very_simple_mathematica.m``.

An example batch submission script for this file is: ::

   #!/bin/bash
   # Request 4 gigabytes of real memory
   #$ -l rmem=4G

   module load apps/mathematica/12.0.0/binary

   math -script very_simple_mathematica.m

Copy and paste the above into a file called ``run_job.sh`` and submit with ::

   qsub run_job.sh

Once the job has successfully completed, the output will be in a file named like ``run_job.sh.o396699``.
The number at the end refers to the job ID given to this job by the system and will be different for you.
Let's take a look at the contents of this file ::

   more run_job.sh.o396699
 
   Mathematica version is 10.2.0 for Linux x86 (64-bit) (July 28, 2015)
   The machine name is node131
   The result of the integral is
   x/2 - Sin[2*x]/4

Installation notes
------------------

These are primarily for administrators of the system.
Download the Mathematica package, ``Mathematica_12.0.0_LINUX.sh``, from Wolfram.
