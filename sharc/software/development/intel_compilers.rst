Intel Compilers
===============

Intel Compilers help create C, C++ and Fortran applications that can take full advantage of the advanced hardware capabilities available in Intel processors and co-processors. They also simplify that development by providing high level parallel models and built-in features like explicit vectorization and optimization reports.

Versions
--------

The Intel compilers were installed as part of :ref:`Intel Parallel Studio <sharc-intel-parallel-studio>`
but can be used with or without the other Parallel Studio components.

After connecting to the ShARC cluster (see :ref:`ssh`), :ref:`start an interactive session <sched_interactive>`
then load a specific version of the compilers using one of: ::

        module load dev/intel-compilers/17.0.0/binary
        module load dev/intel-compilers/16.0.1/binary
        module load dev/intel-compilers/15.0.7/binary

Compilation examples
--------------------

C
^

To compile the C hello world example into an executable called ``hello`` using the Intel C compiler: ::

   icc hello.c -o hello

C++
^^^

To compile the C++ hello world example into an executable called ``hello`` using the Intel C++ compiler: ::

   icpc hello.cpp -o hello

Fortran
^^^^^^^

To compile the Fortran hello world example into an executable called ``hello`` using the Intel Fortran compiler: ::

   ifort hello.f90 -o hello

Detailed Documentation
----------------------
Once you have loaded the module on ShARC, ``man`` pages are available for Intel compiler products: ::

   man ifort
   man icc
