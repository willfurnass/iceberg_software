`FLAMEGPU <http://www.flamegpu.com>`_ is a multi agent simulation framework developed at the University of Sheffield.
It uses GPUs to accelerate the simulation of multiagent systems but abstracts the GPU architecture away from users so that they can write models using a high level of abstraction (without having to write GPU code).


Installing FLAMEGPU on Iceberg
------------------------------


To install FLAME GPU you should checkout the latest master branch of the code which has Linux support ::

    git clone https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU.git

To compile the FLAME GPU examples you will need to be on a GPU node. You can start an interactive session using ::

    qsh -l gpu=1 --l gpu_arch=nvidia-k40m -l rmem=13G

You will then need to load the relevant modules ::

    module load libs/cuda/7.5.18
    module load compilers/gcc/4.9.2

FLAMEGPU allows you to specify a ``CUDA_PATH`` environment variable so that you can change the CUDA version easily. To set this for the CUDA 7.5 module use ::

    export CUDA_PATH=/usr/local/packages6/libs/binlibs/CUDA/7.5.18/cuda

You can now navigate to the FLAME GPU examples folder and build the examples. e.g. ::

    cd FLAMEGPU/examples
    make

You can now run the console versions of the example models by navigating to ``FLAMEGPU/bin/x64`` and calling the appropriate shell script. e.g. ::

    cd ../..
    cd bin/x64
    ./Boids_BruteForce_console.sh

FLAME GPU will run the example for one iteration and output the model state to a file ``1.xml`` in the model's iterations directory.

Visualisation currently does not work with X forwarding as FLAME GPU uses complex rendering techniques which are not supported. A solution using VirtualGL is in progress.
