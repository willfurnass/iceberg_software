   :Version: 3.4.2
   :Support Level: Bronze
   :Dependancies: compilers/gcc/4.8.2
   :URL: http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/
   :Location: /usr/local/packages6/libs/gcc/4.8.2/geos/3.4.2

GEOS (Geometry Engine, Open Source) is a C/C++ port of a subset of 
the `Java Topology Suite <http://locationtech.github.io/jts/>`_ (JTS), 
which in turn is a library that:

> provides an object model for planar geometry together with a set of fundamental geometric functions. 
> JTS conforms to the `Simple Features Specification for SQL <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/sfs>`_ published by the Open GIS Consortium. 
> JTS is designed to be used as a core component of vector-based geomatics software such as geographical information systems. 
> It can also be used as a general-purpose library providing algorithms in computational geometry. 

Usage
-----
To make this library available, run the following module commands

.. code-block:: none

    module load compilers/gcc/4.8.2
    module load libs/gcc/4.8.2/geos/3.4.2

We load version 4.8.2 of gcc since gcc 4.8.2 was used to build this version of geos.

The rgeos interface in R
------------------------
rgeos is a CRAN package that provides an R interface to geos. It is not installed in R by default so you need to install a version in your home directory.

After connecting to iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`), start an interactive session with the :code:`qrsh` or :code:`qsh` command. Run the following module commands ::

    module load apps/R/3.2.0
    module load compilers/gcc/4.8.2
    module load libs/gcc/4.8.2/geos/3.4.2

Launch R and run the command ::

  install.packages('rgeos')

If youâ€™ve never installed an R package before on the system, it will ask you if you want to install to a personal library. Answer ``y`` to any questions you are asked.

The library will be installed to a sub-directory called ``R`` in your home directory and you should only need to perform the above procedure once.

Once you have performed the installation, you will only need to run the ``module`` commands above to make the geos library available to the system. Then, you use ``rgeos`` as you would any other library in R ::

    library('rgeos')

Installation notes
------------------
This section is primarily for administrators of the system.

.. code-block:: none

    qrsh
    tar -xvjf ./geos-3.4.2.tar.bz2
    cd geos-3.4.2
    mkdir -p /usr/local/packages6/libs/gcc/4.8.2/geos/3.4.2
    module load compilers/gcc/4.8.2
    ./configure prefix=/usr/local/packages6/libs/gcc/4.8.2/geos/3.4.2

Potentially useful output at the end of the configure run ::

    Swig: false
    Python bindings: false
    Ruby bindings: false
    PHP bindings: false

Once the configuration was complete, I did ::

	make
	make install

Testing
-------

Compile and run the test-suite with ::

  make check

All tests passed.
