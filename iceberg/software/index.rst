Software on Iceberg
===================

These pages list the software available on iceberg. 
See :ref:`env_modules` for general information on how to load/activate software on the clusters.

If you notice an error or an omission, or wish to request new software
please create an Issue in `this GitHub repository <https://github.com/rcgsheffield/sheffield_hpc/issues>`_


There are many versions of applications, libraries and compilers installed on the iceberg cluster. In order to avoid conflict between these software items we employ a system called modules. Having logged onto a worker nodes, users are advised to select the software (and the version of the software) they intend to use by using the ``module`` command.
