=================================

.. sidebar:: Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)

   :Version:  2.3.63
   :URL: https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/

The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance visualization tool for interactive exploration of large, integrated genomic datasets. It supports a wide variety of data types, including array-based and next-generation sequence data, and genomic annotations.

Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to Iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an graphical interactive session with the `qsh` command. In testing, we determined that you need to request at least 7 Gigabytes of real memory to launch IGV ::

       qsh -l rmem=7G

The latest version of IGV (currently 2.3.63) is made available with the command

.. code-block:: none

        module load apps/binapps/igv

Alternatively, you can load a specific version with ::

        module load apps/binapps/igv/2.3.63

This command makes the IGV binary directory available to your session by adding it to the PATH environment variable. Launch the applications with the command ::

        igv.sh
