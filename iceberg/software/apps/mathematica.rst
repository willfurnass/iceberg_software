Mathematica is a technical computing environment and programming language with strong symbolic and numerical abilities.

Single Core Interactive Usage
-----------------------------
After connecting to iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),
:ref:`start an interactive session <sched_interactive>` then
load a specific version of Mathematica using one of: ::

   module load apps/binapps/mathematica/11.0.1
   module load apps/binapps/mathematica/10.3.1
   module load apps/binapps/mathematica/10.2

Mathematica can then be started using: ::

   mathematica

Multicore Interactive Usage
---------------------------

Mathematica has extensive parallel functionality.
To use it, you should request a parallel interactive session.
For example, to request 4 cores: ::

   qrshx -pe openmp 4

Load and launch Mathematica: ::

   module load apps/binapps/mathematica/11.0.1
   mathematica

In Mathematica, let's time how long it takes to calculate the first 20 million primes on 1 CPU core: ::

   AbsoluteTiming[primelist = Table[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000}];]

When I tried this, I got 78 seconds.
Your results may vary greatly.
Now, let's launch 4 Parallel Kernels and redo the calculation in parallel: ::

   LaunchKernels[4]
   AbsoluteTiming[primelist =
   ParallelTable[Prime[k], {k, 1, 20000000},
   Method -> "CoarsestGrained"];]

When I tried this, I got 29 seconds (around 2.7 times faster).
This illustrates a couple of points:

* You should always request the same number of kernels as you requested when you started your interactive session (in this case, 4).
  If you request more, you will damage performance for yourself and other users of the system.
* N kernels doesn't always translate to N times faster.

Batch Submission
----------------

Unfortunately, it is not possible to run Mathematica notebook ``.nb`` files directly in batch.
Instead, you need to create a simple text file that contains all of the Mathematica commands you want to execute.
Typically, such files are given the extension ``.m``.
Letâ€™s run the following simple Mathematica script as a batch job: ::

   (*Find out what version of Mathematica this machine is running*)
   Print["Mathematica version is " <> $Version]

   (*Find out the name of the machine we are running on*)
   Print["The machine name is " <> $MachineName]

   (*Do a calculation*)
   Print["The result of the integral is "]
   Print [ Integrate[Sin[x]^2, x]]

Copy and paste the above into a text file called ``very_simple_mathematica.m``.

An example batch submission script for this file is: ::

   #!/bin/bash
   # Request 4 gigabytes of real memory
   #$ -l rmem=4G

   module load apps/binapps/mathematica/10.3.1

   math -script very_simple_mathematica.m

Copy and paste the above into a file called ``run_job.sh`` and submit with ::

   qsub run_job.sh

Once the job has successfully completed, the output will be in a file named like ``run_job.sh.o396699``.
The number at the end refers to the job ID given to this job by the system and will be different for you.
Let's take a look at the contents of this file ::

   more run_job.sh.o396699

   Mathematica version is 10.2.0 for Linux x86 (64-bit) (July 28, 2015)
   The machine name is node131
   The result of the integral is
   x/2 - Sin[2*x]/4
