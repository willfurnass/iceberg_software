ORCA is a flexible, efficient and easy-to-use general purpose tool for quantum chemistry with specific emphasis on spectroscopic properties of open-shell molecules. It features a wide variety of standard quantum chemical methods ranging from semiempirical methods to DFT to single- and multireference correlated ab initio methods. It can also treat environmental and relativistic effects.

Making orca available
-----------------------
The following module command makes the latest version of orca available to your session ::

      module load apps/binapps/orca

Alternatively, you can make a specific version available ::

      module load apps/binapps/orca/3.0.3

Example single core job
-----------------------
Create a file called **orca_serial.inp** that contains the following orca commands ::

  #
  # My first ORCA calculation :-)
  #
  # Taken from the Orca manual
  # https://orcaforum.cec.mpg.de/OrcaManual.pdf
  ! HF SVP
  * xyz 0 1
    C 0 0 0
    O 0 0 1.13
  *

Create a Sun Grid Engine submission file called **submit_serial.sh** that looks like this ::

  #!/bin/bash
  # Request 4 Gig of real memory per process
  #$ -l rmem=4G

  module load apps/binapps/orca/3.0.3
  $ORCAHOME/orca example1.inp

Submit the job to the queue with the command ::

    qsub submit_serial.sh

Example parallel job
--------------------
An example Sun Grid Engine submission script is ::

  #!/bin/bash
  #Request 4 Processes
  #Ensure that this matches the number requested in your Orca input file
  #$ -pe openmpi-ib 4
  # Request 4 Gig of real memory per process
  #$ -l rmem=4G

  module load mpi/gcc/openmpi/1.8.8
  module load apps/binapps/orca/3.0.3

  ORCAPATH=/usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/orca/3.0.3/
  $ORCAPATH/orca example2_parallel.inp
