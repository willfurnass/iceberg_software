   :Latest Version: 1.8.0u112
   :URL: https://www.java.com/en/download/

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995.

Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to Iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`), start an interactive session with the `qrsh` or `qsh` command.

The latest version of Java (currently 1.8.0u112) is made available with the command: ::

        module load apps/java

Alternatively, you can load a specific version with one of ::

        module load apps/java/1.8.0u112
        module load apps/java/1.8u71
        module load apps/java/1.7.0u55
        module load apps/java/1.7
        module load apps/java/1.6

Check that you have the version you expect. First, the runtime: ::

        java -version

        java version "1.8.0_112"
        Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_112-b15)
        Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.112-b15, mixed mode)

Now, the compiler ::

        javac -version

        javac 1.8.0_112

Virtual Memory
--------------

.. note::

   The following is only relevant when revisiting older job submission scripts and documentation 
   as the job scheduler :ref:`now polices jobs using real memory, not virtual memory <real-vs-virt-mem>`.

By default, Java requests a lot of *virtual memory* on startup.
This is usually a given fraction of the *physical memory* on a node,
which can be quite a lot on Iceberg.
See :ref:`real-vs-virt-mem` for explanations of the difference between virtual and real/physical memory.

The default amount of virtual memory that Java uses at startup is controlled in two different ways on Iceberg:

For versions **prior to 1.8.0u112** we created a wrapper script to ``java`` that uses the ``-Xmx1G`` switch to force Java to restrict its *heap size* to a maximum of 1 GB of memory.  If this is amount is insufficient, you are free to allocate as much memory as you require by setting your own value for ``-Xmx``.

For example, consider the following submission script: ::

  #!/bin/bash
  #Request 9 gigabytes of real memory from the scheduler (mem)
  #$ -l rmem=9G

  # load the Java module
  module load apps/java/1.8u71

  #Run java program allocating 5 Gigabytes
  java -Xmx5G HelloWorld

Note that **the above is not possible** if an appliation (e.g. a startup script for another software package on the cluster) starts ``java`` itself (instead of you explicitly starting it)
and the above also will not help if an application uses an internally packaged version of Java (rather than one that can be *activated* using ``module load``).

For **versions 1.8.0u112 onwards** the maximum heap size is instead to be restricted using an *environment variable*.  The following is set when you run ``module load ...``: ::

        _JAVA_OPTIONS='-Xmx1G'

You can override this default value by running something like: ::

        export _JAVA_OPTIONS='-Xmx6G'

before starting your application that depends on Java.
``_JAVA_OPTIONS`` can be interpretted by Java programs you start and Java programs started by other programs,
as well as by Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) that you activate using ``module load`` and JVMs that are packaged within applications.

Installation notes
------------------

These are primarily for administrators of the system.

Version 1.8.0u112
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

#. Unpack the Java JDK tarball into ``/usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/java/jdk1.8.0u112/``
#. Install :download:`this modulefile </iceberg/software/modulefiles/apps/binapps/java/1.8.0u112>` as ``/usr/local/modulefiles/apps/binapps/java/1.8.0u112``.

Note that the modulefile contains the following line: ::

        setenv _JAVA_OPTIONS -Xmx1G

Versions prior to 1.8.0u112
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unzip and copy the install directory to ``/usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/java/jdk${VERSION}/``

To fix the virtual memory issue described above, we use a wrapper around the java install that sets Java's maximum heap size (``Xmx``) parameter to a reasonable value.

Create the file ``/usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/java/jdk1.8.0_71/shef/java`` with contents: ::

        #!/bin/bash
        #
        # Java version 1.8 cannot be invoked without specifying the java virtual
        # machine size due to the limitations imposed by us via SGE on memory usage.
        # Therefore this script intercepts the java invocations and adds a
        # memory constraint parameter to java engine unless there was one already
        # specified on the command parameter.
        #
        #
          if test -z "`echo $* | grep -e -Xmx`"; then
        # user has not specified -Xmx memory requirement flag, so add it.
            /usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/java/jdk1.8.0_71/bin/java -Xmx1G $*
        else
        # user specified the -Xmx flag, so don't add it.
            /usr/local/packages6/apps/binapps/java/jdk1.8.0_71/bin/java $*
        fi

The module file is at ``/usr/local/modulefiles/apps/java/1.8u71``. Its contents are ::
