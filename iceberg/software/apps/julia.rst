Julia

.. sidebar:: Julia

   :Versions:  0.5.0-rc3
   :URL: http://julialang.org/

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments.

Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),  
:ref:`start an interactive session <sched_interactive>` then
load a particular version of Julia using: ::

        module load compilers/gcc/5.2
        module load apps/gcc/5.2/julia/0.5.0-rc3

This adds Julia to your PATH and also loads the gcc 5.2 compiler environment with which Julia was built.

Start Julia using: ::

       julia

You can exit a Julia session with the ``quit()`` function.

Installation notes
------------------
These are primarily for administrators of the system.

Julia was installed using gcc 5.2 ::

  module load apps/gcc/5.2/git/2.5
  module load compilers/gcc/5.2
  module load apps/python/anaconda2-2.5.0

  git clone git://github.com/JuliaLang/julia.git
  cd julia
  git checkout release-0.5
  #The next line targets the NEHALEM CPU architecture. This is the lowest architecture available on
  #Iceberg and so the resulting binary will be supported on all nodes. Performance will not be as good as it
  #could be on modern nodes.
  sed -i s/OPENBLAS_TARGET_ARCH:=/OPENBLAS_TARGET_ARCH:=NEHALEM/ ./Make.inc
  make

Module File
