BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner) is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome. It consists of three algorithms: BWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina sequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from 70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as long-read support and split alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is generally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.

Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to Iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),  :ref:`start an interactive session <sched_interactive>`.

Next, load a specific version of bwa with: ::

        module load apps/gcc/5.2/bwa/0.7.12
        module load apps/gcc/5.2/bwa/0.7.5a

This command makes the bwa binary available to your session.

Documentation
-------------
Once you have made bwa available to the system using the `module` command above, you can read the man pages by typing ::

    man bwa
