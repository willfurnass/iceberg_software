IDL is a data analysis language that first appeared in 1977.

Usage
-----
If you wish to use the IDLDE then you may need to request more memory for the interactive 
session using something like ``qsh -l rmem=8G``.

IDL versions can be activated using specific module files::

	module load apps/idl/8.5
	module load apps/idl/8.5ssw
	module load apps/idl/8.4

then run using ``idl`` or ``idlde`` for the interactive development environment. Note apps/idl/8.5ssw is the SolarSoft IDL environment.

The IDL licence is restricted - please contact us via helpdesk if you need to use this software.
