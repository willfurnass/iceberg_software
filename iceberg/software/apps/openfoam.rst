   :Versions: 3.0.0, 2.4.0

OpenFOAM is free, open source software for computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Usage
-----

You can load a specific version of OpenFOAM using one of: ::

       module load apps/gcc/5.2/openfoam/3.0.0
       module load apps/gcc/5.2/openfoam/2.4.0

This has the same effect as sourcing the OpenFOAM ``bashrc`` file, so that should
not be needed.

These ``module load`` commands also load:

* :ref:`OpenMPI <openmpi_gcc_iceberg>` 1.10.0 
* :ref:`GCC <gcc_iceberg>` 5.2
* the :ref:`Scotch <scotch>` 6.0.4 library
