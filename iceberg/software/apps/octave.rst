   :Versions:  4.0.0
   :URL: https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/

GNU Octave is a high-level interpreted language, primarily intended for numerical computations. It provides capabilities for the numerical solution of linear and nonlinear problems, and for performing other numerical experiments. It also provides extensive graphics capabilities for data visualization and manipulation. Octave is normally used through its interactive command line interface, but it can also be used to write non-interactive programs. The Octave language is quite similar to MATLAB so that most programs are easily portable.

Interactive Usage
-----------------
After connecting to iceberg (see :ref:`ssh`),  start an interactive session with either the `qsh` or `qrsh` commands.

The latest version of Octave (currently 4.0.0) is made available with the command

.. code-block:: none

        module load apps/gcc/5.2/octave

Alternatively, you can load a specific version with ::

       module load apps/gcc/5.2/octave/4.0

This adds Octave to your PATH and also loads all of the supporting libraries and compilers required by the system.

Start Octave by executing the command ::

       octave

If you are using a `qsh` session, the graphical user interface version will begin. If you are using a `qrsh` session, you will only be able to use the text-only terminal version.

Batch Usage
-----------
Here is an example batch submission script that will run an Octave program called `foo.m` ::

  #!/bin/bash
  # Request 5 gigabytes of real memory
  #$ -l rmem=5G
  # Request 64 hours of run time
  #$ -l h_rt=64:00:00

  module load apps/gcc/5.2/octave/4.0

  octave foo.m

Using Packages (Toolboxes)
--------------------------
Octave toolboxes are referred to as packages. To see which ones are installed, use the command `ver` from within Octave.

Unlike MATLAB, Octave does not load all of its packages at startup. It is necessary to load the package before its commands are available to your session. For example, as with MATLAB, the `pdist` command is part of the statistics package. Unlike MATLAB, `pdist` is not immediately available to you ::

  octave:1> pdist([1 2 3; 2 3 4; 1 1 1])
  warning: the 'pdist' function belongs to the statistics package from Octave
  Forge which you have installed but not loaded. To load the package, run
  `pkg load statistics' from the Octave prompt.

  Please read `http://www.octave.org/missing.html' to learn how you can
  contribute missing functionality.
  warning: called from
      __unimplemented__ at line 524 column 5
  error: 'pdist' undefined near line 1 column 1

As the error message suggests, you need to load the `statistics` package ::

  octave:1> pkg load statistics
  octave:2> pdist([1 2 3; 2 3 4; 1 1 1])
  ans =

     1.7321   2.2361   3.7417

Installation notes
------------------
These are primarily for administrators of the system.

Octave was installed using gcc 5.2 and the following libraries:

* Java 1.8u60
* :ref:`fltk` 1.3.3
* :ref:`fftw` 3.3.4

* Octave was installed using a SGE batch job. The install script is on :download:`github </iceberg/software/install_scripts/apps/gcc/5.2/octave/install_octave.sh>`
* The make log is on the system at ``/usr/local/packages6/apps/gcc/5.2/octave/4.0/make_octave4.0.0.log``
* The configure log is on the system at `/usr/local/packages6/apps/gcc/5.2/octave/4.0/configure_octave4.0.0.log`

For full functionality, Octave requires a large number of additional libraries to be installed. We have currently not installed all of these but will do so should they be required.

For information, here is the relevant part of the Configure log that describes how Octave was configured ::
