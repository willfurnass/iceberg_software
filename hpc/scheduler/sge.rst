.. _sge-queue:

Starting interactive jobs and submitting batch jobs
===================================================

All job (both interactive sessions and batch jobs) on the University's clusters
are managed using the `Son of Grid Engine <https://arc.liv.ac.uk/trac/SGE>`_
**job scheduling software**.  You will typically see this referred to as
**SGE**, as it is one of several derivatives of `Sun Grid Engine
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Grid_Engine>`_, or sometimes as just the
*scheduler*.

SGE works ass follows: a user requests that a *job* (task), either a script or an
interactive session, be run on the cluster and then SGE will take jobs from
the queue based on a set of rules and priorities.

.. _sge-interactive:

Interactive sessions
--------------------

If you wish to use a cluster for interactive work, such as running applications
like MATLAB or Ansys, or compiling software, you will need to request
interactive session from SGE.  The pre-requisites for this (including
connecting to the clusters) are described in :ref:`getting-started`.

There are three commands for requesting an interactive shell on a cluster worker node:

* :ref:`qrsh` - No support for graphical applications.  Standard SGE command.
* :ref:`qsh` - Supports graphical applications.  Standard SGE command.
* :ref:`qrshx` - Supports graphical applications. Superior to :ref:`qsh`.  Unique to Sheffield's clusters.  

You can configure the resources available to the interactive session by
specifying them as command line options to the ``qrshx``, ``qsh`` or ``qrsh`` commands.
For example to run a ``qrshx`` session with access to 16 GB of RAM: ::

    [te1st@sharc-login2 ~]$ qrshx -l rmem=16G

or a session with access to 8 cores: ::

    [te1st@sharc-login2 ~]$ qrshx -pe smp 8

A table of :ref:`sge-interactive-options` is given below; any of these can be
combined together to request more resources.

.. note::

    Long running jobs *should* use the batch submission system rather than
    requesting an interactive session for a very long time. Doing this will
    lead to better cluster performance for all users.

Common Interactive Job Options
``````````````````````````````

====================== ========================================================
Command                Description
====================== ========================================================
``-l h_rt=hh:mm:ss``   Specify the total maximum execution time for the job.
                       The upper limit is 08:00:00.  NB these limits may
                       differ for specific SGE Projects/Queues.

``-l rmem=xxG``        Specify the maximum amount (xx) of (real) memory to be
                       used (per process or core) in Gigabytes.

``-pe <env> <nn>``     Specify a *parallel environment* and a number of 
                       processor cores.

``-pe smp <nn>``       The smp parallel environment provides multiple threads
                       on one node. ``<nn>`` specifies the max number of
                       threads.

.. _sge-batch:

Running batch jobs
------------------

The power of the clusters really comes from the *batch job* queue submission process.
Using this system, you write a script which requests various resources, initializes the computational environment and then executes your program(s).
The scheduler will run your job when resources are available.
As the task is running, the terminal output and any errors are captured and
saved to disk, so that you can see the output and verify the execution of the
task.

Any task that can be executed without any user intervention while it is running
can be submitted as a batch job. This excludes jobs that require a
Graphical User Interface (GUI), however, many common GUI applications such as Ansys or MATLAB can also be
used without their GUIs.

When you submit a batch job, you provide an executable file that will be run by
the scheduler. This is normally a bash script file which provides commands and
options to the program you are using.
Once you have a script file, or other executable file, you can submit it to the queue by running::

    qsub myscript.sh

Here is an example batch submission script that runs a fictitious program called ``foo``:

   .. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    # Request 5 gigabytes of real memory (mem)
    #$ -l rmem=5G

    # load the module for the program we want to run
    module load apps/gcc/foo

    # Run the program foo with input foo.dat
    # and output foo.res
    foo < foo.dat > foo.res

Some things to note:

* The first line always needs to be ``#!/bin/bash`` (to tell the scheduler that this is a bash batch script).
* Comments start with a ``#``
* Scheduler options, such as the amount of memory requested, start with ``#$``
* You will often require one or more ``module`` commands in your submission file. 
  These make programs and libraries available to your scripts.  
  Many applications and libraries are available as modules on 
  :ref:`ShARC <sharc-software>` and :ref:`iceberg <iceberg-software>`.

Here is a more complex example that requests more resources:

   .. code-block:: bash

    #!/bin/bash
    # Request 16 gigabytes of real memory (RAM)
    #$ -l rmem=16G
    # Request 4 cores in an OpenMP environment
    #$ -pe openmp 4
    # Email notifications to me@somedomain.com
    #$ -M me@somedomain.com
    # Email notifications if the job aborts
    #$ -m a

    # Load the modules required by our program
    module load compilers/gcc/5.2
    module load apps/gcc/foo

    # Set the OPENMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable to 4
    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4

    # Run the program foo with input foo.dat
    # and output foo.res
    foo < foo.dat > foo.res

Scheduler Options
-----------------

====================== ========================================================
Command                Description
====================== ========================================================
``-l h_rt=hh:mm:ss``   Specify the total maximum execution time for the job.
                       The upper limit is typically 96:00:00 (4 days) on ShARC
                       and 168:00:00 (7 days) on Iceberg.  Note that these 
                       limits may differ for specific SGE Projects/Queues.  
                       Also note that requesting less execution time may 
                       result in your job spending less time queuing.

``-l rmem=xxG``         Specify the maximum amount (``xx``) of real memory to be used.

``-l arch=``           Target a processor architecture. This is irrelevant on 
                       ShARC as all processors are the same model.  Options 
                       on Iceberg include ``intel-e5-2650v2`` and ``intel-x5650``.

``-N``                 Job name, used to name output files and in the queue list.

``-j y[es]|n[o]``      Join the error and normal output into one file rather
                       than two.

``-M``                 Email address to send notifications to.

``-m bea``             Type of notifications to send. Can be any combination of
                       begin (``b``) end (``e``) or abort (``a``) i.e. 
                       ``-m ea`` for end and abortion messages.

``-a``                 Specify the earliest time for a job to start, in the
                       format MMDDhhmm. e.g. ``-a 01011130`` will schedule the
                       job to begin no sooner than 11:30 on 1st January.

``-wd working_dir``    Execute  the  job  from  the  directory  specified (i.e.
                       ``working_dir``).

``-l excl=true``       Request exclusive access to all nodes used by the job so
                       no other jobs can run on them.  This can be useful for
                       benchmarking purposes where you want to ensure that you
                       have exclusive use of e.g. memory/IO buses.  Note that
                       you still need to request CPU cores and memory to avoid
                       being limited to just the default per job (one core
                       and a set amount of RAM).  Also note that the use of
                       this option will likely result in longer queuing times.
     
``-l hostname=``       Target a node by name. Not recommended for normal use.

Frequently Asked SGE Questions
------------------------------
**How many jobs can I submit at any one time**

You can submit up to 2000 jobs to the cluster, and the scheduler will allow up to 200 of your jobs to run simultaneously (we occasionally alter this value depending on the load on the cluster).

**How do I specify the processor type on Iceberg?**

Add the following line to your submission script ::

    #$ -l arch=intel-e5-2650v2

This specifies nodes that have the Ivybridge `E5-2650 CPU <http://ark.intel.com/products/75269/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2650-v2-20M-Cache-2_60-GHz>`_.
All such nodes on Iceberg have 16 cores.

To only target the older, 12 core nodes that contain `X5650 CPUs <http://ark.intel.com/products/47922/Intel-Xeon-Processor-X5650-12M-Cache-2_66-GHz-6_40-GTs-Intel-QPI>`_ add the following line to your submission script ::

    #$ -l arch=intel-x5650


**How do I specify multiple email addresses for job notifications?**

Specify each additional email with its own ``-M`` option ::

  #$ -M foo@example.com
  #$ -M bar@example.com

**I want email notifications but don't want to have to include my email address in every job submission script**

Create a file called ``.sge_request`` in the directory you submit your jobs from containing: ::

    -M my.personal@email.com -M my.work@sheffield.ac.uk

The ``-M`` parameter will be automatically supplied for all future job submissions.
Note that you still need to request email notifications using ``-m`` (see above).

**How do you ensure that a job starts after a specified time?**

Add the following line to your submission script ::

    #$ -a time

but replace ``time`` with a time in the format ``MMDDhhmm``.

For example, for 22nd July at 14:10, you'd do ::

    #$ -a 07221410

This won't guarantee that it will run precisely at this time since that depends on available resources. It will, however, ensure that the job runs *after* this time. If your resource requirements aren't too heavy, it will be pretty soon after. When I tried it, it started about 10 seconds afterwards but this will vary.
